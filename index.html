      <h2>Long ago, in a galaxy not so far away...</h2>
<p>Long ago, in a galaxy not so far away, a force of love was born. Today, we gather to honor the birthday of a remarkable woman, a Jedi Master in her own right, whose wisdom guides us through the darkest of nights and whose laughter resonates like the music of the Force itself. May your journey through this galaxy be filled with joy, adventure, and countless blessings. Happy Birthday to my dear mami, whose light shines brighter than a thousand suns in our universe. May the force be with you today and always as you continue to inspire us with your strength and grace.</p>
